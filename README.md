# Project Description: Custom IoT Dashboard for Smart Environment Control and Analysis

During a 24-hour hackathon, our team embarked on an ambitious project to design and prototype an innovative IoT dashboard. This dashboard is tailored to seamlessly integrate and manage a wide array of custom components, addressing the need for a flexible and adaptive solution in monitoring and controlling smart environments.

## Core Functionalities and Scenarios Addressed:

- **Environmental Conditions Monitoring:** At the heart of our solution is the capability to equip rooms with sensors for real-time tracking of environmental conditions, including temperature, humidity, pressure, and light intensity. Our dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to display and analyze these metrics, enabling optimized environmental control.

- **Window and Door Status Detection:** Leveraging smart sensor technology, our system can detect open or closed states of windows and doors. By incorporating pressure sensors, it further enhances the accuracy of detecting changes in room conditions due to open windows, offering a sophisticated approach to maintaining security and environmental stability.

- **Smart Room Control:** The dashboard serves as a central control unit for managing smart devices within a room, including lights, projectors, and other IoT-enabled devices. It supports various control mechanisms, from dedicated hardware devices and mobile applications to web-based interfaces, ensuring convenience and accessibility for users such as facility managers and educators.

- **Intelligent Lighting and Projector Management:** Our platform enables the remote control of lighting and projectors via the internet, integrating smart switches with IoT Gateway and MQTT broker for automated and responsive control based on predefined rules or environmental cues.

- **Smart Services Implementation:** The dashboard incorporates smart services like "Night Mode" and "Good Morning" routines, automating device behavior to enhance comfort and energy efficiency. It also includes a "Vacation Mode" to simulate occupancy, adding an extra layer of security for users away from home.

- **Innovative Applications and Data Utilization:** Beyond automation, our solution explores creative scenarios such as setting up an Escape Room with interconnected IoT devices, offering unique entertainment experiences. It also emphasizes the importance of data collection and analysis, enabling insights into room utilization, environmental trends, and optimization opportunities for resource savings.

This prototype represents a significant step forward in smart environment management, demonstrating the potential for IoT technology to enhance efficiency, comfort, and security in various settings. Our team's commitment to flexibility and innovation has resulted in a dashboard that not only meets the immediate needs of a smart environment but also offers scalability for future expansions and integrations.
